# AI Agent Search Assistant

This demo is an interactive, agent-based search system built with **LangChain**, **OpenAI GPT-4o**, and **SerpAPI**. It dynamically uses tools such as web summarization, event extraction, local map rendering, and related question expansion to generate high-quality answers to natural language queries.

## How to Run

1. Download the notebook and open it on your local machine.  
2. Run each cell in order to initialize the environment.  
3. To test your own query, add a new cell with:

   ```python
   run_agent_with_classification("your query")

and run the cell.
